This repository is for the implimentation of repetitive experiment, which allows suffcient data for machine learning algorithm
This is some codes and files of IV Cannulation Needle Sensor Project.

This repository including:

Controling the robotic arm with Arduino and CNC shield.  
Impelement of Moku:Go Functions (Frequency Response Analyzer, Ocsolliscope) via Python API for signal excitations and recordings.  
Example of combine robot motion and Moku:Go command into full experimental operation sequence.  
Neural Networks Models training and testing, Reduced Order Modeling Method.
